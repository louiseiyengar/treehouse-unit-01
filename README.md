# Treehouse Techdegree: FSJS project 1 - A Random Quote Generator

This project will present one HTML web page with a quote randomly selected from the 
quotes array (in the file: quotes.js).  The quotes will be authored either by Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, or Oscar Wilde.

The quote display will also have an attribute, containing an image and name of the author of the quote, and, conditionally (if they exist),
the novel, play, or book of essays from which the quote came, the character that said the quote, and the date the quote's source was published.

In addition, one of twelve background colors will be randomly chosen to display with each quote change.

Finally, the quotes will change after a set number of seconds (const delayInMilliseconds) or if you press a button.
